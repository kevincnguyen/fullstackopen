# Full Stack Open 2023

### About this repository
This repository contains my solutions to exercises from the 2022-23 edition of the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course from the University of Helsinki.
The course dives into modern JavaScript-based web development with a focus on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.
